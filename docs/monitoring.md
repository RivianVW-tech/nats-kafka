# Monitoring the NATS-Kafka Bridge

The nats-kafka bridge provides optional HTTP/s monitoring. When [configured with a monitoring port](config.md#monitoring) the server will provide four HTTP endpoints:

* [/varz](#varz)
* [/healthz](#healthz)
* [/metrics](#metrics)
* [/dashboard](#dashboard)

<a name="varz"></a>

## /varz

The `/varz` endpoint returns a JSON encoded set of statistics for the server. These statistics are wrapped in a root level object with the following properties:

* `start_time` - the start time of the bridge, in the bridge's timezone.
* `current_time` - the current time, in the bridge's timezone.
* `uptime` - a string representation of the server's up time.
* `http_requests` - a map of request paths to counts, the keys are `/`, `/varz`, `/healthz`, `/metrics` and `/dashboard`.
* `connectors` - an array of statistics for each connector.
* `nats` - wire-level statistics for the bridge's shared NATS connection, omitted when there is no connection.

Each object in the connectors array, one per connector, will contain the following properties:

* `name` - the name of the connector, a human readable description of the connector.
* `id` - the connectors id, either set in the configuration or generated at runtime.
* `connects` - a count of the number of times the connector has connected.
* `disconnects` -  a count of the number of times the connector has disconnected.
* `bytes_in` - the number of bytes the connector has received, may differ from received due to headers and encoding.
* `bytes_out` - the number of bytes the connector has sent, may differ from received due to headers and encoding.
* `msg_in` - the number of messages received.
* `msg_out` - the number of messages sent.
* `count` - the total number of requests for this connector.
* `rma` - a [running moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) of the time required to handle each request. The time is in nanoseconds.
* `q50` - the 50% quantile for response times, in nanoseconds.
* `q75` - the 75% quantile for response times, in nanoseconds.
* `q90` - the 90% quantile for response times, in nanoseconds.
* `q95` - the 95% quantile for response times, in nanoseconds.
* `num_pending` - for JetStream sources, the consumer backlog observed on the last delivered message.

The `nats` object contains the statistics reported by the NATS client library for the shared connection.
STAN traffic flows over the same connection and is included in these numbers.

* `connected` - whether the connection is currently up.
* `connected_url` - the URL of the NATS server the bridge is connected to.
* `reconnects` - the number of reconnects.
* `in_msgs` / `out_msgs` - messages received from / sent to NATS.
* `in_bytes` / `out_bytes` - bytes received from / sent to NATS.

## /healthz

The `/healthz` endpoint is provided for automated up/down style checks. The server returns an HTTP/200 when running and won't respond if it is down.

<a name="metrics"></a>

## /metrics

The `/metrics` endpoint exposes the same statistics in the Prometheus exposition format, so a Prometheus server can scrape the bridge directly.
It is served whenever monitoring is enabled and can be turned off with the `disablemetrics` [configuration setting](config.md#monitoring).
Standard Go runtime and process metrics are included alongside the bridge metrics below.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_info` | gauge | `version` | Build information, value is always 1. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_start_time_seconds` | gauge | | Unix time the bridge started. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_http_requests_total` | counter | `path` | Requests served by the monitoring endpoints. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_connector_connected` | gauge | `connector` | Whether the connector is connected (1) or not (0). |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_connector_connects_total` | counter | `connector` | Times the connector has connected. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_connector_disconnects_total` | counter | `connector` | Times the connector has disconnected. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_connector_messages_in_total` | counter | `connector` | Messages read from the connector's source. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_connector_messages_out_total` | counter | `connector` | Messages successfully written to the destination. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_connector_bytes_in_total` | counter | `connector` | Payload bytes read from the source. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_connector_bytes_out_total` | counter | `connector` | Payload bytes successfully written to the destination. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_connector_requests_total` | counter | `connector` | Messages fully processed by the connector. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_connector_request_duration_seconds` | summary | `connector` | End-to-end handling time, quantiles 0.5/0.75/0.9/0.95. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_connector_pending_messages` | gauge | `connector` | JetStream consumer backlog at the last delivered message. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_nats_connected` | gauge | | Whether the shared NATS connection is up. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_nats_reconnects_total` | counter | | Reconnects on the shared NATS connection. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_nats_in_msgs_total` | counter | | Messages received over the shared NATS connection. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_nats_out_msgs_total` | counter | | Messages sent over the shared NATS connection. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_nats_in_bytes_total` | counter | | Bytes received over the shared NATS connection. |
| `nats_kafka_bridge_nats_out_bytes_total` | counter | | Bytes sent over the shared NATS connection. |

Notes:

* The `connector` label is the connector's configured name, which stays stable across restarts.
* When a failing connector is restarted by the bridge its counters reset to zero. Prometheus `rate()` and `increase()` handle these resets natively.
* The duration summary quantiles are computed over the connector's lifetime, not a sliding window, and cannot be aggregated across bridge instances.

A minimal scrape config:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: nats-kafka-bridge
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["bridge-host:9222"]
```

<a name="dashboard"></a>

## /dashboard

The `/dashboard` endpoint serves a self-contained browser dashboard with no external dependencies.
It polls `/varz` every few seconds and shows NATS wire traffic rates (bytes read from and written to NATS), aggregate and per-connector message rates, cumulative totals, failed deliveries, JetStream backlog, and message handling latency quantiles.
It is served whenever monitoring is enabled and can be turned off with the `disabledashboard` [configuration setting](config.md#monitoring).
